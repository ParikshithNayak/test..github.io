                  This is an amazingly intricate series which portrays the rise of a working class, notoriously dangerous family in Birmingham during the 1920's. The thing about period dramas is that you need to be patient because they tend to start slow. It takes an episode or two to introduce its characters and that's when you start feeling accustomed to the pace. Everything from the sets, to the dresses, the aristocracy. balance between love and violence and the impeccable dialogue delivery of whichever accent WILL make you fall in love with the show. Even though you may find some loose ends in the story, the performances and the cinematography are more than enough to keep you hooked. It  A must for people who love period dramas.

                  This is one of the best TV series for the people who love dark, serious and strategical based TV series. Peaky Blinders is all about how hard work and correct strategy can raise a person and its family from Ashes to an epitome of success. 
                  People might find initially Peaky Blinders to be a bit boring but please hold your patience a bit because it's one of the best gifts from NETFLIX. Trust me if you can have keep bit of patience then this series would turn out to be a sweet drug. 
                  This is historical fiction after the end of World War based on the street gang called Peaky Blinders on the streets of Birmingham and his main character Tommy Shelby hoe sharpness and right decision can take person to a next level. 
                  Overall this is an adult series with a lot of darkness serious matter political agendas but a platter to those people who love stories and want to learn something from  TV Series.
